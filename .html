<h2>Here are reasons why you aren't great:<br><br></h2>
<ul><p3>You are so far away</p3></ul>


<p3>In all seriousness though Sohphia, I do hope that you enjoyed this small excursion that I have sent you, and I hope that you feel better and things start looking up, and hopefully it helps me seem a little more real and less like a bunch of pixels and sounds through your phone.
    <br> Also, I'm obviously writing this before I've actually put it together and sent it, but at current at the very least, I'm considering a getting a blanket to send you also, but obviously since it's always so hot for you - at least in summer- I feel like it will be a bit pointless...
